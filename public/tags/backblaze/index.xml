      <description>Restic is a nifty backup tool written using GOLANG. It can encrypt backups, do deduplication and is compatible with all common cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s storage offerings. Here we will be backing up super important data to BackBlaze B2.
BackBlaze B2 Cloud Storage is pretty great. the company are open and up front about their costs and publish a regular report on drive stats. The idea of using backblaze here for me is simple - I already back up locally but want to make sure that my data is also stored safely off site.</description>
